The goal of this App is to be a straight-through connector between external billing service API "Evotor" and standard Google sheets API. While running it waits until Evotor send a json_ed version of bill or any other transaction info through web hooks and then, after conversion, it resends gathered info next to Google sheet doc. User needs only to enter a google link into the form and proceed through authorization process once, after that app keeps all the credentials for future use and keeps functioning in standalone mode.

Skills: Java/Spring/Bootstrap/Google Sheets API (OAuth2)
